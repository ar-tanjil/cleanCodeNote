# Formatting

## Vertical Formatting

### 1. The Newspaper Metaphor

Think of a well-written newspaper article. You read it vertically. At the top you expect a
headline that will tell you what the story is about and allows you to decide whether it is
something you want to read. The first paragraph gives you a synopsis of the whole story,
hiding all the details while giving you the broad-brush concepts. As you continue downward,
the details increase until you have all the dates, names, quotes, claims, and other minutia.

### 2. Vertical Openness Between Concepts

Nearly all code is read left ot right and top to bottom. Each line represents an expression or
a clause, and each group of lines represents a complete thought. Those thoughts should be
separated from each other with blank lines.

### 3. Vertical Density

If openness separates concepts, then vertical density implies close association. So lines
of code that are tightly related should appear vertically dense.

### 4. Vertical Distance

Concepts that are closely related should be kept vertically close to each other.
Clearly this rule doesnâ€™t work for concepts that belong in separate files. But then closely
related concepts should not be separated into different files unless you have a very good
reason. Indeed, this is one of the reasons that protected variables should be avoided.

- *Variable Declarations* - Variable should be declared as close to their usage a possible. Local variables should
  appear a th top of each function. Control variables for loops should usually be declared
  within the loop statement.
- *Instance Variables* - Instance variables should be declared at the top of the class.
- *Dependent Functions* - If one function calls another, they should be vertically close,
  and the caller should be above the callee, if at all possible.
- *Conceptual Affinity* - Certain bits of code want to be near other bits. They have a certain
  conceptual affinity. the stronger that affinity, the less vertical distance there should be
  between them.

### 5. Vertical Ordering

In general we want function call dependencies to point in the downward direction. That is,
a function that is called should be below a function that does the calling. This creates a
nice flow down the source code module from high level to low level.

## Horizontal Formatting

Line should be 100 to 120 characters long.

### 1. Horizontal Openness and Density

We use horizontal white space to associate things that are strongly related and disassociate
things that are more weakly related.

### 2. Horizontal Alignment

Horizontal Alignment has no benefit.

### 3. Indention

Do indention

### 4. Dummy Scopes

*Don't do this, use braces*

```java
public void method() {
    while (dis.read(buf, 0, readBufferSize) != -1)
        ;
}
```

## Team Rules

Everyone has favourite rule, but when working on team follow
the team rule.
